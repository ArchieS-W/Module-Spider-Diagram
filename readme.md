# Module Spider Diagram

## Problem Statement

University Modules have prerequisites as you progress through the years and module complexity. There is no place to easily see all of the prerequisites needed for each module in a cohesive manner. Currently, one must go through each and every module page to find the necessary prerequisite modules.

## Solution

Create an interactive webpage spider diagram for each course detailing which module leads to which and showing the prerequisite links for each. Also show which modules are available in each year and across different courses.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Spider Diagram**: Visualize module dependencies using a spider diagram for a clear understanding of prerequisites.

- **Prerequisite Information**: Easily access detailed information about prerequisite modules for each course.

- **Yearly Availability**: View module availability in different academic years to plan course schedules effectively.

- **Cross-Course Comparison**: Compare module availability across different courses for informed decision-making.
